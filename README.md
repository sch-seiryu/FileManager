# FileManager
Manage numerous files at once, with simple and concise scripts. It is focused on 'what you actually want to do', instead of existing utilities/libraries, efficiency, safety, precision, and adaptability. Using Python may provide some versatility over non-Windows OS, it is not recommended to use this software on other OS, and I claim that I don't have any responsibilities at all. #Python #Windows #File #FileSystem #FileManagementSystem #FileManager #FileScript
